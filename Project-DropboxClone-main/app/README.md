# **Dropbox Clone**

## **Description**  
This repository contains the source code for a Dropbox-like file storage application, inspired by the Hcode course. The project demonstrates the implementation of file management functionalities, user authentication, and integration with Firebase for real-time database management.

## **Project Objectives**  
- Build a Dropbox clone using the concepts taught in the Hcode course.  
- Develop an intuitive interface for file upload, retrieval, and management.  
- Integrate Firebase for real-time data storage and updates.  
- Apply JavaScript and Node.js techniques to handle backend operations.  
- Ensure scalability and maintainability with a well-structured codebase.  

## **Implemented Features**  
### **Core Features**  
- **Frontend Integration:** Cloning the HTML and CSS from the course project.  
- **Project Setup:** Initialization using Express Generator.  
- **File Upload:** Implemented using AJAX and `Promise.all()` for handling multiple files.  
- **Backend Processing:** Node.js receives and processes files with the `Formidable` library.  
- **Progress Updates:** Updating the view with upload progress information.  
- **Template Management:** Organizing and displaying file types with specific templates.  
- **Firebase Integration:** Adding Firebase to the application and managing data in the Firebase database.  
- **Real-Time Updates:** Listing and synchronizing file data stored in Firebase.  

## **Tech Stack**  
- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime for server-side execution.  
- **Express:** Web framework for building RESTful APIs.  
- **Formidable:** Middleware for handling file uploads.  
- **Firebase:** Backend-as-a-Service for database and real-time synchronization.  
- **AJAX:** For asynchronous HTTP requests to improve user experience.  
- **HTML/CSS:** Frontend cloning from the Hcode course.  

## **Why did I do this project?**  
This project was built as part of the Hcode course to learn practical web development and backend integration techniques. It allowed me to gain hands-on experience in building a file management application with real-time capabilities.

## **Notice**  
This project has been successfully completed. All planned features have been implemented, and the application is stable and ready for use.

### **Status**  
**Completed!** The project is finalized and fully functional.
